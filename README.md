## Olympics Data Analysis

### Overview
This project involves analyzing Olympic data to gain insights into athlete participation, medal distribution, and other related aspects. The analysis is performed using Python, and the report includes detailed explanations and visualizations.

### Libraries Used
The analysis heavily relies on the following Python libraries:

- **NumPy:** Used for mathematical functions and handling large-dimensional arrays.
- **Pandas:** A powerful tool for data wrangling, providing quick and easy data manipulation, aggregation, and visualization. It handles one-dimensional (Series) and two-dimensional (Data Frame) data.
- **Matplotlib:** Offers various methods for visualizing data, allowing quick creation of line graphs, pie charts, histograms, and other professional-grade figures.
- **Seaborn:** A Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

### Dataset
Two main datasets are used for the analysis:

1. [Athletes Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tejaschaudhari192/Olympics-data-analysis/master/Dataset/athlete_events.csv)
2. [Regions Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tejaschaudhari192/Olympics-data-analysis/master/Dataset/noc_regions.csv)

### Implementation
The Python implementation involves data reading, merging, and analysis using Pandas. Key steps include:

1. Reading CSV files for athletes and regions.
2. Merging datasets using Pandas merge function.
3. Cleaning and organizing the dataset.
4. Descriptive statistics and visualization of key features.
5. Analysis of participation, medals, and other relevant factors.

### Notebooks
- [Python Implementation.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VG9ewFqF1_artHPqsEbXIZ0kAGNaTrgO#scrollTo=5UJoXwS8r1nf&printMode=true): The main notebook containing the Python code and visualizations.

### Tableau Implementation
In addition to Python, Tableau is utilized for further data visualization. The Tableau implementation includes a story named 'Athletes and NOC Region Dataset Analysis' with multiple dashboards covering various aspects of the data.

### Dashboards
1. Athletes in India
2. Top 10 Countries Participated in Athletics
3. Overall Participation by Countries
4. Age-wise Number of Participants
5. Medals Won by Females in Athletics
6. Male and Female Participation in Athletics
7. Medals Won by Athletes
8. Gold Medals Won by Top 10 Countries
9. Participation of Females Over Time
10. Gold Medals in Athletics
11. Participation of Females from Top 10 Countries
12. Medals Won by a Particular Gender
13. Season-Wise Sports

### Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into Olympic data, offering a detailed understanding of athlete participation, medal distribution, and trends over time. Both Python and Tableau are utilized to present a comprehensive analysis.
